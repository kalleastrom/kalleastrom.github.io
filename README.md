## PhD student positions
I am looking for talented students (PhD/MSc) who are interested in doing exciting research in computer vision, geometry and machine learning.

## PhD position (May 2024) Differentiable Neural Acoustics
The project is about developing 3D mapping methods for sound and radio. In particular, we will focus on methods which takes as input a set of sound or radio recordings and produces a map consisting of for example the sound events, the microphone positions and the room geometry.
We will study and develop differentiable methods based on discrete features and continuous representations that will allow the use of efficient data-driven deep learning approachs to enhance the current state-of-the-art. The position is funded by the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program](https://wasp-sweden.org) within the **Differentiable Neural Acoustics” project**.

My colleague **Carl Olsson** also has a position funded by [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program](https://wasp-sweden.org) on **Matrix factorization and optimization**. It is posted on the same place, i.e. [here](https://lu.varbi.com/en/what:job/jobID:717159/).
