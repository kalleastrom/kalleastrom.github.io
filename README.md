## PhD student positions
I am looking for talented students (PhD/MSc) who are interested in doing exciting research in computer vision, geometry and machine learning.

## PhD position (May 2024) Differentiable Neural Acoustics
The project is about developing 3D mapping methods for sound and radio. In particular, the project aims at developing new theory and methods for differentiable neural acoustics. We will study and develop differentiable methods based both on discrete features and continuous representations. The position is funded by the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program](https://wasp-sweden.org) within the “Differentiable Neural Acoustics” project.

Note that the subject area for the PhD is mathematics and applicants will need to take math courses during their PhD studies. Please contact me for more details.
